    <h2 class="introductionH2"> Elise is the name a miku fan of heart</h2>
    <p class="introductionText"> Hi there im Elise. I'm a huge fan of Hatsune Miku and currently studying an IT bachelor. <br>
        Im 24 years old as of moment of typing and live on my own <br>
        In my free time I like to be a content creator on the internet. <br>
        I often make YouTube content and stream on twitch. I do all sorts of stuff  <br>
        But im mostly a Project Diva/Horror youtuber. On twitch i like to switch around<br>
        With one Project Diva stream in the weekend and something else in the week <br>
        But i also do plenty of other stuff on my channels make sure to check it out <br>
        Interested in the content I make on Youtube or twitch?. <br>
        Let me show you my mark powers and watch the video on the page. I also have a discord <br>
        So if your interested to stay up to date then make sure to join that in the menu left.</p>
    <p class="introductionText"> I also like to draw and play games. I'm very creative <br>
        Something you think might be obvious with the all the content creation <br>
        I mostly like to play with friends but don't hesitate to play something on my own <br>
        Well you know introverted nature.  But feel free to look further around <br>
        With love your trans girl Elise &#10084; </p>

    <h2 class="introductionH2"> Youtube </h2>
    <p class="introductionText"> Schedule for uploads and stream..... oh that is good a one. <br>
    Should we start with the YouTube then. As i said earlier i'm an Project Diva/Horror youtuber <br>
    But i also do lots of other stuff on the channel. But question remains how much do i upload then? <br>
        I aim for 3x uploads a week with a extra horror vid on friday. But the list is as follows <br> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1x Random game Video</li>
        <li>1x Project diva Video (Has priority)</li>
        <li>1x Random game Video and 3 scary games video on friday</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="introductionText">
    I still aiming to keep a Horror friday with 2 uploads each time. <br>
        Also 3 scary games is my only real consistent thing on the channel. <br>
        I upload that every friday or try that to around 20:00 CET/CEST <br>
        Besides that you can expect at least 1 project diva video in the week <br>
        But as i said i also do plenty of other stuff make sure to check the video out on the page here!
    </p>
    <h2 class="introductionH2"> Twitch </h2>
    <p class="introductionText"> So now comes the question twitch he.... Well let me tell you <br>
    Back in March 2022 i made the decision to go on a weekly schedule. <br>
    This primarily with the reason of a upcoming Internship semester and my of course new Transgender life <br>
    So once a week on sunday i make a schedule for upcoming week and post it. <br>
    You can find the schedule then on the following places </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>In my Discords Schedule channel</b> Can be found under the Socials category</li>
        <li><b>My twitter.</b> i also post announcements here if i go live on the day</li>
        <li><b>My Instagram.</b> i also post announcements here if i go live on the day</li>
        <li><b>Vods Youtube channel.</b> Good place if you wanna see how stream goes</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="introductionText"> All these socials can be found in the menu of the left <br>
    With the red YouTube icon being my Vods YouTube channel <br>
    Do i catch you maby live once on twitch in the future <br>
